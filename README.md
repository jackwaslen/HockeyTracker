# Quick Note

I've written several blog posts about this project, breaking down the code and my thought process around it. Check out my medium at [medium link](https://medium.com/@jackwaslen16)

# Description

Fed up with other Hockey Apps, I decided to build one myself. I wanted to it to be clean and simple, while also feeling like it fits in the broader Apple Eco-System. I was lucky enough to come across a free to use hockey database at [rapid-api](https://rapidapi.com/palsoft/api/hockey-live-sk-data/details), which contains accurate and update-to-date stats. Big thanks to Pavol Svanter for allowing me to us his data!

In the app, I build an HTTP Manager. Which is explained in depth here: [HTTP Manager](https://medium.com/stackademic/heres-how-to-connect-to-restful-api-s-in-swift-http-manager-5f34b156ebc6)
